# Developing Checkers

## Project Description
As part of a project submission, I made a game of American Checkers with rules slightly modified. The technologies and tools used for the project are based on what I have learnt thus far. 

## Technologies & Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Git & GitHub

## Timeframe
- ~A week

## Game Description
The rules of the game are based on American Checkers with the exception of the King piece and triple-jumps that were not made available at this point in time.
